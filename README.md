# zero
Zero-label highway driving

Status: Deprecated in favor of unsupervised learning from video frame prediction (v1 project). Other teams trying supervision from physics found it challenging as well. But learned a lot.

Target abstract: We demonstrate that it is possible to train an object detector for autonomous driving applications using zero labels, only the laws of physics. The detector achieves [very high]% MAP when trained on the Kitti self-driving dataset, but is trained entirely without labels.
